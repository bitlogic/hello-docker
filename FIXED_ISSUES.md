# 🐳 Docker Tutorial - Issues Fixed!

## ✅ What I Fixed For You

### 1. **Docker Installation**
- **Problem**: Docker wasn't installed on your system
- **Solution**: Installed Docker CE 28.3.0 using the official installation script
- **Verification**: Successfully ran `docker run hello-world` ✓

### 2. **Docker Service Setup**
- **Problem**: Docker daemon wasn't running
- **Solution**: Started Docker daemon manually (since no systemd)
- **Status**: Docker is now running and responsive ✓

### 3. **User Permissions**
- **Problem**: Would need `sudo` for every Docker command
- **Solution**: Added your user (`ubuntu`) to the `docker` group
- **Note**: You'll need to log out/in or restart your session for this to take full effect

### 4. **Environment Ready**
- **Status**: Your Docker learning environment is now fully functional!
