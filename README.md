An entry level `docker tutorial` üê≥  for anyone who wants to learn how to use docker effectively in their day-to-day dev work. 

![Docker Small](./0-orientation/horizontal_small.png) 


## Getting Started

This **docker tutorial** attempts to drive you through the fundamentals and into some advanced topics like `docker services` and  `docker stacks` and `docker's swarm mode`. Just in case, you can also grab the [Docker Cheatsheet](https://github.com/bitlogic/hello-docker/tree/master/docker-cheatsheet.md)


So, let's get started in the [orientation section](https://github.com/bitlogic/hello-docker/tree/master/0-orientation). :punch:


### Pre Requisites

To start with the tutorial you'll need to have `docker 24.0` or later installed in your machine.  So go ahead and [install the latest stable version here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

You can check the version with the following command.
``` 
$ docker --version
Docker version 27.3.1, build ce12230
```
