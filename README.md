## Getting Started 🚀

This **docker tutorial** attempts to drive you through the fundamentals 📖 and into some advanced topics like `docker services` ⚙️ and  `docker stacks` 📦 and `docker's swarm mode` 🐝. Just in case, you can also grab the [Docker Cheatsheet](https://github.com/bitlogic/hello-docker/tree/master/docker-cheatsheet.md) 📝


So, let's get started in the [orientation section](https://github.com/bitlogic/hello-docker/tree/master/0-orientation). :punch: 💪


### Pre Requisites ✅

To start with the tutorial you'll need to have `docker 24.0` or later installed in your machine. 💻 So go ahead and [install the latest stable version here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) 🔗

You can check the version with the following command. 🔍
``` 
$ docker --version
Docker version 27.3.1, build ce12230
```
